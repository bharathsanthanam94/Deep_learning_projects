# Deep_learning_projects
This repository contains projects completed for Udacity's Deep learning Nanodegree. The projects are related to Deep Neural networks, convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and model deployment using Amazon's AWS Sagemaker.


**1. Predicting Bike sharing Data**

In this project, Deep learning is implemented from ground-up to predict daily bike rental ridership. The code is from UCI Machine learning repository.

**2. Convolutional Neural Netwwork (CNN) project**

Built a pipeline to process user-supplied images. Given an image of the dog, the algorithm will find the canine's breed. If the supplied image is a human face,
the algorithm will identify the closest resembling dog breed.

Tools and skills used : Pytorch, CNN, Transfer learning. Refer https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git for dataset and project deliverables.

**3. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) project**

Implemented Generative Adversarial Networks to generate new images of human faces. For project instructions, files and datasets, refer the public repo,
https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-face-generation

Tools and skills used : Pytorch, Deep Convoutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN).

**4. Model deployment to predict Sentiment analysis**

Built and deployed a neural netowkr which predicts the sentiment of a user-provided movie review. In addition, a simple web-app has been created that uses the deployed model.

Tools and skills used : Pytorch, AWS Sagemaker,Lambda function. 

Datasets used: IMDB datasets- http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/
